# Advent of code

Here you can find the resolutions of every algorithm problems for the advent of code. (Based on an friend's existing repo: [fermeaux/aoc](https://github.com/fermeaux/advent-of-code-2021) with some personal tweaks to adapt to powershell and add a year parameter.)

Run an existing problem solution:

```
npm start --aocYear=2022 --aocDay=1
```

Watch in dev mode an existing problem solution:

```
npm run watch --aocYear=2022 --aocDay=1
```

Create a new file resolver for a specific day/year

```
npm run new --aocYear=2022 --aocDay=1
```

Fetch the puzzle file for a specific day/year

```
npm run fetch-data --aocYear=2022 --aocDay=1
```

> Note: You must set your session id of your account on advent of code in the env variable: $AOC_SESSION_ID

Initialize a new day and be ready to develop

```
npm run init --aocYear=2022 --aocDay=1
```
